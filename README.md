# How to Run App

This project is structured into two folders - client, and server.

For installing and running the client, run `npm i` from inside the `/client` directory and `npm run start` to start the React app locally. You should see the app running on `http://localhost:3000`

For installing and running the server, run `npm i` from inside `/server` and run `npm run start`. The Node server should be live at `http://localhost:8000`. You should see `⚡️[server]: Server is running at https://localhost:8000`.

With the server running, enter some investment amounts and click 'Prorate' to see request.
